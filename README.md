# Nyles - An Assistant for The More Tech-Savy User

*Author* Christopher R. Hill

## Overview 
This is just a fun experiment with creating an assistant that would run on 
MacOS machines that will leverage the power of google and other apis to answer
questions like "What's the weather like today?" and "What's the weather for the rest of the week?".

I'd like to support commands that create events, read emails and other content, along with 
search for twitter updates for usernames. 

## Requirements 
* MacOS
* Python 3.6

## Set-up
* You'll need a DarkSky API Key - https://darksky.net
	** In the `keys` directory, there is a file called api_keys.json.  You'll need to update this
	   to include your DarkSky API Key.
